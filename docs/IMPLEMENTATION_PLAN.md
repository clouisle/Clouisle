# Implementation Plan

## Active

- **sandbox-runtime-migration** — In progress. Migrate subprocess-based code execution to a long-running sandbox worker runtime that supports Python/JS package installation, CLI and custom command execution, skill compilation, and compatibility bridges for tools, chat, and workflow code nodes. See `docs/plan/sandbox-runtime-migration.md`
  - [ ] 1. Runtime contracts, policies, and compatibility schema
  - [ ] 2. Queue, gateway, and result transport
  - [ ] 3. Long-running worker, scheduler, and workspace/process isolation
  - [ ] 4. Python environment cache and CLI execution
  - [ ] 5. Node environment cache and CLI execution
  - [ ] 6. Tool, chat, and workflow entry migration
  - [ ] 7. Skill compilation and frontend editor/test path
  - [ ] 8. Deployment rollout, observability, and legacy deprecation

- **agent-media-tool-failure-visibility** — Complete. Restored visible media success/failure rendering across live chat, regenerate, and history recovery, while normalizing unsupported image quality values before provider calls. See `docs/plan/agent-media-tool-failure-visibility.md`
  - [x] 1. Backend media SSE parity and tool error flags
  - [x] 2. Frontend history tool error restoration
  - [x] 3. Image quality normalization and validation
  - [x] 4. Targeted verification

- **mermaid-streaming-growth** — In progress. Rework chat Mermaid streaming so diagrams advance only on stable render frontiers, preserve the last successful SVG during streaming, and animate only newly appeared nodes and edges. See `docs/plan/mermaid-streaming-growth.md`
  - [ ] 1. Frontier-based Mermaid rendering
  - [ ] 2. Stable session identity and visual continuity
  - [ ] 3. Entry animation and verification

- **agent-context-compression-ratio-thresholds** — In progress. Upgrade agent context compression from hard-budget-only behavior to staged context governance with ~80% proactive compaction, selective micro compaction, richer compression observability, and a Phase 2 Session Memory / SM Compact roadmap. See `docs/plan/agent-context-compression.md`
  - [x] 1. Ratio-based thresholds and pressure states
  - [x] 2. Selective micro compaction
  - [x] 3. Compression observability and frontend messaging
  - [x] 4. Phase 2 Session Memory / SM Compact design hooks

- **workflow-duplicate-input-params** — Complete. Prevented duplicate input parameter names in workflow code nodes via runtime executor validation, config-time validation, and frontend dialog guards. Tracked as GitHub issue #99. See `docs/plan/fix-duplicate-input-params.md`
  - [x] 1. Add runtime validation in base executor
  - [x] 2. Add config validation in code node
  - [x] 3. Add i18n error messages
  - [x] 4. Add frontend dialog duplicate detection

- **agent-manual-stop-state** — Complete. Persisted manual stop state for interrupted agent replies so the current UI and reloaded history both show a stable stopped marker. See `docs/plan/agent-manual-stop-state.md`
  - [x] 1. Backend persisted stop state
  - [x] 2. Frontend stop finalization
  - [x] 3. History rendering and verification

## History

- **agent-context-compression** — Complete. Added shared agent context compression for non-stream, stream, and regenerate flows, with agent-level compression config and frontend-visible compression SSE events.

- **agent-chat-parity** — Aligned non-streaming agent chat request semantics with the streaming path for file parsing, vision inputs, history overrides, user-input-request prompting, and tool metadata/timeouts.

- **backend-babel-i18n-migration** — Introduced a Babel-backed backend i18n runtime with compatibility fallback so existing `t()`, `msg_key`, `BusinessError`, and `ResponseCode` flows stayed compatible during migration.
